# Refactor RESTful API

One way to refactor the code is to create separate modules for the routes and database connection logic.

- Created a separate routes folder and added a users.js file to it. GET and POST endpoints for users from app.js file to users.js file.
- Created a separate models folder and added a user.js file to it. userSchema and User model definitions from app.js file to user.js file.
- In the app.js file, userSchema and User model definitions have been removed and imported the users router from the routes/users.js file.
- To implement input validation, we can use a library like joi that provides a simple and powerful schema validation. We can define a schema for each request's body and validate it before processing the request.
- To implement rate limiting, we can use a middleware function that limits the number of requests per IP address over a certain period.
- To optimize database queries and indexing, we can add indexes to the fields that are frequently queried.

By adding the index to the email field, we can speed up the GET request that searches for all users by email.

Overall, these changes improve the maintainability, security, and performance of the RESTful API.
